# vaultwarden2keepass

Backup your bitwarden/vaultwarden vault to a KeePass database. In case of catastrophic server failures you can fall back on your keepass file.

This is similar to projects like [lazywarden](https://github.com/querylab/lazywarden) or [bitwarden-to-keepass](https://github.com/k3karthic/bitwarden-to-keepass). Here are some differences:

- ✅ Backup includes organization items
- ✅ Backup includes attachments (size limit configurable)
- ✅ Minimalistic but informative log output
- 🛑 No interfaces to cloud/storage providers. Move created backup yourself wherever you need it (inspiration for your consideration: [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) or [rclone](https://rclone.org/))
- 🛑 No scheduler. You may setup cron or similar to trigger the script regularly.
- 🛑 No alternative login methods. Just API-key + Password.

# Usage

## With docker compose

- Download `docker-compose.yml` from this repository
- Edit environment variables
- Run `docker compose up`

## Without docker

- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/genericFJS/vaultwarden2keepass.git`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and change variables
- Open a console in the cloned repository
- Run `npm install` or `pnpm install` once
- Run `npm run start:env` or `pnpm start:env` whenever you want to create a backup

# Configuration

Use the following environment variables to configure the script:

\*: In most cases these environment variables are stored in plain text. That means they can easily be read. To make this _somewhat_ more secure and conceal them on first sight, your passwords have to be base64-encoded. To encode your password in base64 use some (online) tool of your choice or just open the developer tools console in any browser (usually via F12) and use the output of `btoa("your_password")`.
\*\*: In flat-mode, all organization entries are saved in the organization itself without creating keepass groups for folders/collections (the folder/collections information is instead saved to a field). Nested-mode creates keepass groups for folders/collections and creates duplicate entries to sort into these groups. The advantage of flat-mode is, that there are no duplicate entries, so entries are better found by searching. The advantage of nested-mode is, that it more closely resembles the structure of the items in vaultwarden, so entries are better found by browsing. Decide yourself, what's more important for your backup strategy.

Depending how you use this script (preferably in your local network), you may access your self-hosted vaultwarden/bitwarden server with a self signed certificate. In this case just set the node environment variable which disables certificate checking: `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.
